                Many have known about the "planet" Pluto before 2006. 
                Many have heard of the planet Pluto but some may have forgotten that 
                Pluto was once a planet. Since it did not meet the IAU criteria it was 
                stripped off of its status year 2006. However, Pluto is instead
                called a Dward Planet that is in Kuiper belt.

            <h3>Is a Pluto a planet?</h3>
                <p> 
                Even though Pluto isn't a planet in our solar system however it is a dwarf planet
                in Kuiper Belt. Before Pluto was removed from its title, it was indeed the 9th planet
                in our solar system.
